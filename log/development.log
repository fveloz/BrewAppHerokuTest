The Doctor heads back to the TARDIS looking for Rose but instead is shocked to hear the TARDIS phone on the outside of the box is ringing.

Harkness slips out and rescues Rose using the tractor beam from a Chula warship that he is piloting. At the same time, the Doctor catches up to Nancy and a group of children who have broken into a house to eat a dinner that's been left out by the owners who are hiding from the air raid. The Doctor sits down to eat with them and asks if they've seen Rose before asking Nancy about the phone. Nancy asks the Doctor to leave, but before he can the child in the gas mask knocks at the door asking for his mummy. Nancy panics and orders everyone to leave out a separate entrance. She bolts the front door and refuses to let the child in. The Doctor asks why and she tells him it's not a real boy and that he shouldn't touch the child or he will become empty like it is. The phone rings in the hall and the boy continues knocking but disappears as the Doctor opens the door.\r\nOn the Chula ship, Captain Jack introduces himself to Rose and flirts openly with her before parking the ship in front of Big Ben and camouflaging it. They stand on top of the ship and open a bottle of champagne. On the streets, the Doctor catches up to Nancy and questions her again about the boy. She tells him that the item that fell from the sky is related to the boy, and that it's under heavy guard nearby. She also admits that she is caring for the other children because she lost her brother to a recent air raid. The Doctor gives her some encouraging words about the future and they set off together for a nearby hospital.

Rose and Jack arrive at the hospital in time to save the Doctor from the transformed Constantine and patients.

Jack teleports back to his ship and plays music over the radio to prevent Jamie from using the radio to track the Doctor and Rose. Challenged by Rose to dance while they wait, the Doctor accepts but is interrupted when they are teleported to Jack's Chula ship. The Doctor uses the ship's nanogenes to heal a wound while Jack explains that he went renegade from the Time Agency after they stole two years of his memories. Meanwhile, Nancy returns to the railyard to tell the other children they are not safe while they are with her. She tells them she is heading to the bomb site, but is captured by soldiers before she can reach it. Despite her pleas, she is left with an infected guard who grows a gas mask on his face.", "walkthrough"=>"he Doctor, Rose, and Jack arrive at the bomb site and realise that the contagion is now airborne as the soldiers begin to transform. They free Nancy, who saved herself by singing a lullaby to the transformed soldier. The Doctor investigates the bomb, which is the cylinder he was chasing at the beginning of the last episode. He determines it is the empty shell of a Chula medical transport. Realising that the ship also contained nanogenes, the Doctor deduces that the transformations are caused by nanogenes who have used Jamie's dead body in a gas mask as a template for all humans. Because the Chula were a warrior race and the transport was a battlefield ambulance, the nanogenes have given the transformed beings enhanced abilities.\r\nThey attempt to open the cylinder but instead trigger an alarm that calls all of the transformed humans to defend it. The altered people from the hospital arrive at the railway station. The Doctor reasons that since Jamie was the template, it is his mind that drives them hence their collective obsession with finding a mother. A distraught Nancy claims that the situation is all her fault before tearfully admitting that she's not his sister but instead is actually his mother.

The Doctor uses the ship's nanogenes to heal a wound while Jack explains that he went renegade from the Time Agency after they stole two years of his memories. Meanwhile, Nancy returns to the railyard to tell the other children they are not safe while they are with her.

They free Nancy, who saved herself by singing a lullaby to the transformed soldier. The Doctor investigates the bomb, which is the cylinder he was chasing at the beginning of the last episode. He determines it is the empty shell of a Chula medical transport. Realising that the ship also contained nanogenes, the Doctor deduces that the transformations are caused by nanogenes who have used Jamie's dead body in a gas mask as a template for all humans. Because the Chula were a warrior race and the transport was a battlefield ambulance, the nanogenes have given the transformed beings enhanced abilities.\r\nThey attempt to open the cylinder but instead trigger an alarm that calls all of the transformed humans to defend it. The altered people from the hospital arrive at the railway station. The Doctor reasons that since Jamie was the template, it is his mind that drives them hence their collective obsession with finding a mother. A distraught Nancy claims that the situation is all her fault before tearfully admitting that she's not his sister but instead is actually his mother. Jamie heads through the gate and approaches Nancy, still asking if she is his mother. The Doctor pushes Nancy to tell Jamie the truth, which she does while hugging him.

Back in the year 2000, our friend, Vic Kralj, who owns the Bistro in Hayward, California, decided to have his first ever Double IPA festival. Vic invited 10 breweries, 6 of whom (including us) had to brew something special for him since we had nothing that would fall under this style category. Vinnie had made a Double IPA at Blind Pig in 1994, but was not brewing one at Russian River Brewing at the time. He had an idea for the recipe, but not a name. After much research in beer books, brainstorming, and deliberation, we came up with \"Pliny the Elder\". Pliny, the man, lived in the first century- 23 to 79 A.D. According to our brewing references, he and his contemporaries either created the botanical name or at least wrote about Lupus Salictarius, or hops, currently known as Humulus Lupulus. That was a very early reference to an important part of any Double IPA! Pliny the beer has now become one of our flagship brews!", "walkthrough"=>"Pliny the Elder was immortalized by his nephew, Pliny the Younger, who wrote about his uncle succumbing to ash and smoke during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. while rescuing people. Cheers to the scholar, historian, officer, writer, and Roman Naturalist- Pliny the Elder!\r\n", "fermentables_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"120L Crystal", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"27"}, "1"=>{"name"=>"Blind Pig IPA", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"28"}}, "hops_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Warrior", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"14"}, "1"=>{"name"=>"Warrior", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"15"}, "1371395087321"=>{"name"=>"Batman", "_destroy"=>"false"}}, "yeasts_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"007 Dry English", "id"=>"14"}}, "extras_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"", "id"=>"14"}}}, "commit"=>"Update Brew", "id"=>"14"}

A well known cartoon from Private Eye pictured a group of Daleks at the foot of a flight of stairs with the caption, \"Well, this certainly buggers our plan to conquer the Universe\". In a scene from the serial Destiny of the Daleks, the Doctor and companions escape from Dalek pursuers by climbing into a ceiling duct. The Fourth Doctor calls down, \"If you're supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don't you try climbing after us?\"[22] The Daleks generally make up for their general lack of mobility with overwhelming firepower; a joke among Doctor Who fans goes, \"Real Daleks don't climb stairs; they level the building.\"[23] Dalek mobility has improved over the history of the series: in their first appearance, The Daleks, they were capable of movement only on the conductive metal floors of their city; in The Dalek Invasion of Earth a Dalek emerges from the waters of the River Thames, indicating that they not only had become freely mobile, but are amphibious;[24] Planet of the Daleks showed that they could ascend a vertical shaft by means of an external anti-gravity mat placed on the floor; and Remembrance of the Daleks depicted them as capable of hovering up a flight of stairs.[25] Despite this, journalists covering the series frequently refer to the Daleks' supposed inability to climb stairs; characters escaping up a flight of stairs in the 2005 episode \"Dalek\" made the same joke, and were shocked when the Dalek began to hover up the stairs after uttering the phrase \"ELEVATE\", in a similar manner to their normal phrase \"EXTERMINATE.\".[9] The new series depicts the Daleks as fully capable of flight, even space flight.[14]", "fermentables_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Dalek Sec", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"29"}, "1"=>{"name"=>"Dalek Caan", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"30"}}, "hops_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Dalek Thay", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"17"}, "1"=>{"name"=>"Dalek Jast", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"18"}}, "yeasts_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Culture of Skaro", "id"=>"15"}}, "extras_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"", "id"=>"15"}}}, "commit"=>"Update Brew", "id"=>"15"}

The cylinder, marked as dangerous, skips in and out of the time vortex before landing somewhere on Earth. The Doctor lands the TARDIS in London, and he and Rose walk over to a nearby restaurant to ask about the cylinder. The Doctor uses a microphone to ask if anything has fallen from the sky recently, only to hear an air raid siren and realize it's World War II and he's in London during The Blitz. Meanwhile, Rose spots a young boy asking for his mummy and follows him to a rooftop, where she becomes entangled in the ropes of a barrage balloon and carried away. The Doctor heads back to the TARDIS looking for Rose but instead is shocked to hear the TARDIS phone on the outside of the box is ringing. As he is about to answer, a young woman named Nancy interrupts and warns him not to. The Doctor answers the phone anyway, and a young man asks for his mummy. The line cuts out and a confused Doctor follows Nancy.", "walkthrough"=>"Meanwhile, Rose is trapped on the balloon as the air raid happens and is spotted by Captain Jack Harkness, who is posing as an officer in the RAF. Harkness slips out and rescues Rose using the tractor beam from a Chula warship that he is piloting. At the same time, the Doctor catches up to Nancy and a group of children who have broken into a house to eat a dinner that's been left out by the owners who are hiding from the air raid. The Doctor sits down to eat with them and asks if they've seen Rose before asking Nancy about the phone. Nancy asks the Doctor to leave, but before he can the child in the gas mask knocks at the door asking for his mummy. Nancy panics and orders everyone to leave out a separate entrance. She bolts the front door and refuses to let the child in. The Doctor asks why and she tells him it's not a real boy and that he shouldn't touch the child or he will become empty like it is. The phone rings in the hall and the boy continues knocking but disappears as the Doctor opens the door.\r\nOn the Chula ship, Captain Jack introduces himself to Rose and flirts openly with her before parking the ship in front of Big Ben and camouflaging it. They stand on top of the ship and open a bottle of champagne. On the streets, the Doctor catches up to Nancy and questions her again about the boy. She tells him that the item that fell from the sky is related to the boy, and that it's under heavy guard nearby. She also admits that she is caring for the other children because she lost her brother to a recent air raid. The Doctor gives her some encouraging words about the future and they set off together for a nearby hospital. Back at Big Ben, Captain Jack plays music and dances with Rose before admitting that he's a former time agent and that he has an item for sale. Rose bluffs him, telling him that he needs to take her to her partner before she can buy it.\r\nAt the hospital near where the cylinder crashed, the Doctor encounters Doctor Constantine caring for a room full of patients that all have the same symptoms. They are all seemingly comatose, with the same scar on their hands and with gas masks fused to their face. Doctor Constantine demonstrates that each responds identically and simultaneously to a loud noise. He starts to explain that the first patient with these symptoms was Nancy's brother Jamie, but before he can finish he transforms into another gas mask clad victim. Rose and Jack arrive at the hospital in time to save the Doctor from the transformed Constantine and patients. Escaping deeper into the building, Jack again attempts to sell the warship to the Doctor who gets Jack to admit that it is only a Chula medical ship. Jack denies that it has anything to do with the current outbreak.\r\nThe episode ends as the three are trapped in a room while the transformed patients converge upon them, all asking for their mummy.

The phone rings in the hall and the boy continues knocking but disappears as the Doctor opens the door.\r\nOn the Chula ship, Captain Jack introduces himself to Rose and flirts openly with her before parking the ship in front of Big Ben and camouflaging it. They stand on top of the ship and open a bottle of champagne. On the streets, the Doctor catches up to Nancy and questions her again about the boy. She tells him that the item that fell from the sky is related to the boy, and that it's under heavy guard nearby. She also admits that she is caring for the other children because she lost her brother to a recent air raid. The Doctor gives her some encouraging words about the future and they set off together for a nearby hospital. Back at Big Ben, Captain Jack plays music and dances with Rose before admitting that he's a former time agent and that he has an item for sale. Rose bluffs him, telling him that he needs to take her to her partner before she can buy it.\r\nAt the hospital near where the cylinder crashed, the Doctor encounters Doctor Constantine caring for a room full of patients that all have the same symptoms. They are all seemingly comatose, with the same scar on their hands and with gas masks fused to their face. Doctor Constantine demonstrates that each responds identically and simultaneously to a loud noise. He starts to explain that the first patient with these symptoms was Nancy's brother Jamie, but before he can finish he transforms into another gas mask clad victim. Rose and Jack arrive at the hospital in time to save the Doctor from the transformed Constantine and patients. Escaping deeper into the building, Jack again attempts to sell the warship to the Doctor who gets Jack to admit that it is only a Chula medical ship. Jack denies that it has anything to do with the current outbreak.\r\nThe episode ends as the three are trapped in a room while the transformed patients converge upon them, all asking for their mummy.

Daleks have been seen to be able to use their plungers to interface with technology, crush a man's skull by suction, measure the intelligence of a subject, and extract information from a man's mind. Dalek casings are made of a bonded polycarbide material dubbed \"dalekanium\" by a member of the human resistance in The Dalek Invasion of Earth and by the Cult of Skaro in \"Daleks in Manhattan\".", "walkthrough"=>"For many years it was assumed that, due to their design and gliding motion, Daleks were unable to climb stairs, and that this was a simple way of escaping them. A well known cartoon from Private Eye pictured a group of Daleks at the foot of a flight of stairs with the caption, \"Well, this certainly buggers our plan to conquer the Universe\". In a scene from the serial Destiny of the Daleks, the Doctor and companions escape from Dalek pursuers by climbing into a ceiling duct. The Fourth Doctor calls down, \"If you're supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don't you try climbing after us?\"[22] The Daleks generally make up for their general lack of mobility with overwhelming firepower; a joke among Doctor Who fans goes, \"Real Daleks don't climb stairs; they level the building.\"[23] Dalek mobility has improved over the history of the series: in their first appearance, The Daleks, they were capable of movement only on the conductive metal floors of their city; in The Dalek Invasion of Earth a Dalek emerges from the waters of the River Thames, indicating that they not only had become freely mobile, but are amphibious;[24] Planet of the Daleks showed that they could ascend a vertical shaft by means of an external anti-gravity mat placed on the floor; and Remembrance of the Daleks depicted them as capable of hovering up a flight of stairs.[25] Despite this, journalists covering the series frequently refer to the Daleks' supposed inability to climb stairs; characters escaping up a flight of stairs in the 2005 episode \"Dalek\" made the same joke, and were shocked when the Dalek began to hover up the stairs after uttering the phrase \"ELEVATE\", in a similar manner to their normal phrase \"EXTERMINATE.\".[9] The new series depicts the Daleks as fully capable of flight, even space flight.[14]", "fermentables_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Dalek Sec", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"29"}, "1"=>{"name"=>"Dalek Caan", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"30"}, "1371399458188"=>{"name"=>"Sonic Screwdriver", "_destroy"=>"false"}}, "hops_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Dalek Thay", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"17"}, "1"=>{"name"=>"Dalek Jast", "_destroy"=>"false", "id"=>"18"}}, "yeasts_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Culture of Skaro", "id"=>"15"}}, "extras_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"", "id"=>"15"}}}, "commit"=>"Update Brew", "id"=>"15"}
